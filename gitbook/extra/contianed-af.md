# Contained.af

> Game for learning about containers, capabilities, and syscalls by [@jessfraz](https://github.com/jessfraz)

There is a CTF on every VM instance. If  you manage to break out of the container, email `not.quite@contained.af` and you will be rewarded. If  you bother this email address with anything that is not the ASCII art contents of the flag file you will be ignored.
